See this [post on reddit for good details](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/36ndcy/how_do_i_remove_old_stainpaint_from_a_wood_deck/crftvig/?st=j6n33h23&sh=4f2a1efe)


Option 1: Refinish it yourself.

*~$165* for renting. A couple of days to sand down paint. More days to paint.

Option 2: Hire someone to refinish it. Apparently it is about $3.00 / sq. ft. to refinish.

*~$1000-$1500*
